Generates minecraft map art based on an input image.

You don't need a modded minecraft client or anything fancy- you just need command (/setblock) access on your server.

To use:

1. Drop in image.png in the project folder (make sure to crop it to 128x128, or 256x256, or whatever)

2. edit X_OFFSET and Y_OFFSET variables to be whatever you want

3. run it

4. switch active window to minecraft

5. afk for about an hour
